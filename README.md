# LotFP-Character-Gen-Playtest

The objective of this program is to create a quick character for the latest Lamentations of the Flame Princess playtest rule set. Please note this program is unofficial and has been done purely to assist in me learning Python3 - if it creates something that people can use afterwards, then excellent.

Current Features:

- Generate 6 random numbers between 3 and 18 (to act as 3d6 rolls) and assign them to the stats.
- Works out if the values total above 54, re-rolling if they dont.
- Works out the Save Vs Magic dice
- Works out the Save vs Non Magic dice
- Works out the initiative
- Works out the HP
- Works out the Encumberance
- Randomly picks a class

Planned Features:

- Skill point allocation
- Magic spell allocation (if applicable)
